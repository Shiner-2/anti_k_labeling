First line contain 5 number n, E, k, LB, UB

First number is the amount of vertical (n)

Second number is the amount of edges (E)

Third number is the amount of labels (k)

Last is the upperbound (UB)

Then there is another E lines follow, each line contain 2 number indicate there is an edge between this two vertical
